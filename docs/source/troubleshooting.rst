The automated install commands fail
===================================

These failures are often due to unstable internet connections causing the download of the pseudopotential archive from the web to fail.
In this case, it is possible to install the family manually from an archive that is already available on the local file system.
You can read more on this in the :ref:`how-to section <how-to:install_archive>`.
